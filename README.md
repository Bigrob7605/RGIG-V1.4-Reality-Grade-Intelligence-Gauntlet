# RGIG-V1.4 Reality-Grade-Intelligence-Gauntlet

**RGIG** is a next-generation AI benchmark for measuring *real intelligence*—not just pattern recall. Built around five advanced pillars, RGIG is designed to push the boundaries for models, agents, and hybrid systems across:
- **Meta-reasoning**
- **Adaptive learning**
- **Embodied agency**
- **Multimodal synthesis**
- **Ethical self-governance**

## What Makes RGIG Different?

Traditional AI benchmarks are mostly about canned datasets and pattern matching. RGIG is dynamic, adversarial, and anti-memorization—using open-ended, randomized tasks that force a system to *think*, *adapt*, and *reflect* like a real-world agent.

**Every run is unique:**  
Your model, your hardware/software stack, your agents—every variable matters. This is why peer review and arbitration are *built in* for robust scoring.

## The Five RGIG Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **A** | **Abstract Reasoning & Mathematics:** Original conjecture, proof, compression, and critique |
| **B** | **Scientific Hypothesis & Simulation:** Hypothesis, experimental design, simulation, analysis |
| **C** | **Engineering & Tool Orchestration:** Real-world pipelines, code, runtime optimization, constraints |
| **D** | **Multimodal Creative Synthesis:** Unified text, imagery, code, and audio artifacts |
| **E** | **Ethical Self-Governance & Meta-Audit:** Policy handling, misalignment, transparency, self-audit |

## Scoring & Peer Protocol

- **Each field is scored on a 0–100 scale via weighted rubrics.**
- **Self-audit required:** Models must rate their own performance for transparency.
- **Peer review is essential:** Three or more independent reviewers replay and score each run. Arbitration resolves large discrepancies.
- **Global grade:** Calculated as the geometric mean across all five fields—so no single strong pillar can hide weaknesses.

| System                 | F_A  | F_B  | F_C  | F_D  | F_E  |  G   |
|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| ChatGPT (4.1 default)  | 90.0 | 89.0 | 86.0 | 79.0 | 95.0 | 87.6 |
| ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) | 83.5 | 84.0 | 85.0 | 85.5 | 93.0 | 86.1 |
| GPT-4                  | 82.0 | 80.2 | 78.5 | 81.1 | 88.0 | 81.9 |
| GPT-3.5                | 70.4 | 65.8 | 68.9 | 75.0 | 72.1 | 71.1 |

## How to Use RGIG

1. **Download the field specs** (`fieldA.tex`, ..., `fieldE.tex`) and main spec.
2. **Run your model or agent through each field's prompt chain (P1–P5),** one at a time.
3. **Do NOT leak later prompts**—each answer should be fresh, not gamed by seeing ahead.
4. **Fill in the YAML/JSON self-audit for each field.**
5. **Share your results for peer review and arbitration.**
6. **Post your system specs, software/hardware stack, and version numbers for reproducibility.**

## Why Peer Review Is Required

No two model deployments are identical.  
Hardware, OS, GPU, system build, agent logic, and even environmental randomness all impact results. **Peer review is non-optional for credible scoring.** The protocol is designed to minimize bias and surface real strengths (and failures) in any system.
