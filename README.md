Here’s a **tightened, clarified, and up-to-date README.md** for V1.9—matching your current PDF, license, and “blueprint, not SaaS” vision. I fixed minor issues, added a “No Hosting/No Centralization” highlight, and modernized a few sections:

# RGIG – Reality Grade Intelligence Gauntlet

**RGIG** is an open, next-generation intelligence benchmark that goes beyond pattern recall.
Built around five advanced pillars, RGIG pushes the limits of AI, agents, and hybrids on:

* **Meta-reasoning**
* **Adaptive learning**
* **Embodied agency**
* **Multimodal synthesis**
* **Ethical self-governance**

---

## What Makes RGIG Different?

Most AI benchmarks measure recall or narrow tasks. **RGIG is adversarial, open-ended, and randomized.**
Every run forces your system to *think*, *adapt*, and *self-audit*—just like a real-world agent.
**No leaderboard, no server, no central data.** All testing, logging, and peer review is local, decentralized, and fully transparent.

## The Five RGIG Fields

| Field | Description                                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A** | **Abstract Reasoning & Mathematics:** New conjectures, proof, compression, critique             |
| **B** | **Scientific Hypothesis & Simulation:** Hypothesis, experiment, simulation, analysis            |
| **C** | **Engineering & Tool Orchestration:** Real-world pipeline design, code, runtime constraints     |
| **D** | **Multimodal Creative Synthesis:** Unified text, image, code, and audio artifacts               |
| **E** | **Ethical Self-Governance & Meta-Audit:** Policy detection, alignment, transparency, self-audit |

---

## Scoring & Peer Review

* **Each field is scored 0–100 via weighted rubrics.**
* **Self-audit required:** Every run includes a YAML/JSON self-critique.
* **Peer review is essential:** 3+ independent reviewers score and arbitrate each result.
* **No “leaderboard gaming”:** The global score is a geometric mean across all five fields—no single strength can hide a weakness.

| System                 | F\_A | F\_B | F\_C | F\_D | F\_E | G    |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ChatGPT (4.1 default)  | 90.0 | 89.0 | 86.0 | 79.0 | 95.0 | 87.6 |
| ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) | 83.5 | 84.0 | 85.0 | 85.5 | 93.0 | 86.1 |
| GPT-4                  | 82.0 | 80.2 | 78.5 | 81.1 | 88.0 | 81.9 |
| GPT-3.5                | 70.4 | 65.8 | 68.9 | 75.0 | 72.1 | 71.1 |

*See the [spec PDF](./RGIG%20-%20Reality%20Grade%20Intelligence%20Gauntlet%20-%20Benchmark%20Specification%20V1-9.pdf) for methodology and rubrics.*

## How To Use RGIG

1. **Download** the spec (`main.tex` and `fieldA-E.tex`) or the PDF.
2. **Run your system** through each field’s prompt chain (P1–P5/P6), one at a time.
3. **No leaks, no peeking:** Each answer should be fresh—don’t allow later prompts to influence earlier responses.
4. **Fill out self-audit** YAML/JSON per field.
5. **Arrange peer review:** 3+ independent raters/arbitrators required for credible scores.
6. **Document your system:** Share hardware, software, stack, and version info.

---

### No Hosting, No Centralization

> **RGIG is fully decentralized.**
> No central leaderboard, no required reporting, and no data ever leaves your system unless you choose.
> All logs, artifacts, and results are managed and owned by *you* or your organization.
> Fork, remix, and extend—no permissions needed.

---

## Why Peer Review Matters

Every system, build, and hardware stack is unique.
Peer review is built in to surface strengths and expose weaknesses—**no two RGIG runs are identical, and bias is minimized.**
This is a *reality-grade* test, not a leaderboard stunt.
