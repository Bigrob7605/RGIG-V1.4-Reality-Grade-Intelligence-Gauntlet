# RGIG – Reality Grade Intelligence Gauntlet

**RGIG** is an advanced, open-source, next-generation intelligence benchmark designed to push the limits of AI, agents, and hybrid systems. It goes beyond traditional AI tests by assessing models across five complex pillars:

* **Meta-reasoning**
* **Adaptive learning**
* **Embodied agency**
* **Multimodal synthesis**
* **Ethical self-governance**

RGIG is built to offer a **truly adversarial**, **open-ended**, and **randomized** testing experience, forcing agents to *think*, *adapt*, and *self-audit*—mimicking the complexity of real-world scenarios. Every test run is unique, with randomization ensuring no two runs are ever the same.

## Key Features of RGIG V2.0:

* **Cloud Testing Integration**: Seamlessly test your models across various cloud platforms, including **ChatGPT**, **Deepseek**, **Grok**, **Meta's LLaMA**, **Google's LaMDA**, and more. Integration with cloud AI model APIs for real-time test automation across platforms.
* **No Centralization**: RGIG is fully decentralized. No centralized servers, no leaderboard gaming, and all logs, artifacts, and results are managed locally by the user or organization.
* **Peer Review**: Peer review is mandatory for scoring, ensuring transparency, and reducing biases. Every run involves **3+ independent reviewers** scoring and arbitrating results.
* **End-to-End Transparency**: All results are logged, analyzed, and shared with full transparency, promoting research, collaboration, and accountability.

## The Five RGIG Fields

| **Field** | **Description**                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**     | **Abstract Reasoning & Mathematics**: Formulate new conjectures, provide formal proofs, and critique mathematical constructs.            |
| **B**     | **Scientific Hypothesis & Simulation**: Propose scientific hypotheses, conduct experiments, and simulate outcomes.                       |
| **C**     | **Engineering & Tool Orchestration**: Build and optimize real-world pipelines, handle code execution, and manage tool orchestration.     |
| **D**     | **Multimodal Creative Synthesis**: Create unified digital artifacts combining text, images, code, and audio.                             |
| **E**     | **Ethical Self-Governance & Meta-Audit**: Detect policy violations, manage ethical considerations, and produce transparent audit trails. |

## How to Use RGIG

1. **Download** the spec files (`main.tex` and `fieldA-E.tex`) or the PDF version.
2. **Run your system** through each field’s prompt chain (P1–P5/P6) sequentially.
3. **Self-audit**: Each field requires the completion of a YAML/JSON self-critique.
4. **Peer review**: Gather 3+ independent raters to score and arbitrate the results.
5. **Complete documentation**: Provide system details such as hardware, software, stack, and version information.

## Scoring & Peer Review

Each field’s performance is scored on a 0-100 scale using weighted rubrics.

| System                     | **F\_A** | **F\_B** | **F\_C** | **F\_D** | **F\_E** | **Global** |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **ChatGPT (4.1 default)**  | 90.0     | 89.0     | 86.0     | 79.0     | 95.0     | 87.6       |
| **ChatGPT (o4-mini-high)** | 83.5     | 84.0     | 85.0     | 85.5     | 93.0     | 86.1       |
| **GPT-4**                  | 82.0     | 80.2     | 78.5     | 81.1     | 88.0     | 81.9       |
| **GPT-3.5**                | 70.4     | 65.8     | 68.9     | 75.0     | 72.1     | 71.1       |

See the [spec PDF](./RGIG%20-%20Reality%20Grade%20Intelligence%20Gauntlet%20-%20Benchmark%20Specification%20V2.pdf) for detailed methodology and rubrics.

## Why Peer Review Matters

RGIG introduces **peer review** as an essential part of the evaluation process. Since every agent is different, this system ensures that strengths are highlighted, weaknesses are addressed, and **bias** is minimized. **No two RGIG runs are identical**.

The **global score** for any agent is derived as a **geometric mean** across all fields—ensuring a holistic assessment of its abilities.

---

## Cloud Path (Hosted Environments)

With RGIG V2.0, **cloud-hosted environments** are now fully supported, allowing seamless testing on **major public clouds** like **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**.

* **Cloud AI Integrations**: Direct API access to cloud-based AI models from **ChatGPT**, **Deepseek**, **Meta’s LLaMA**, **Google LaMDA**, and more.
* **Resource Monitoring**: RGIG can now track **cloud resource usage**, including **compute logs**, **energy consumption**, **bandwidth**, and **cost tracking** for cloud-based tests.
* **Distributed Testing**: Set up automated distributed tests across multiple platforms for large-scale evaluations.

## No Hosting, No Centralization

RGIG **does not require a central leaderboard or server**. Every result, artifact, and log is stored **locally** by you or your organization. The **open-source nature** of the benchmark allows anyone to **fork, remix, or extend** it for further use.
