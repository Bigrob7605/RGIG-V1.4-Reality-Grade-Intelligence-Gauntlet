# RGIG V3.5 – Reality Grade Intelligence Gauntlet  
**Cloud & Tab Benchmarking Suite for AGI/LLMs**  
*Open-source | Peer-verified | Future-proof | AGI-ready*

**RGIG (Reality Grade Intelligence Gauntlet)** is the next-generation benchmark for testing artificial intelligence systems—**from LLMs to AGI**—across the full spectrum of cognitive, creative, engineering, and ethical capability.

**V3.5 introduces:**
- 🌐 **Cloud Mode:** One-click Docker/Colab deploy for labs, teams, and regulators.
- 🗂️ **Tab Mode:** Instant, code-free benchmarking in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other browser-based LLMs.
- 🤝 **Peer Review & Audit:** Built-in self-audit, YAML/JSON logging, and transparent peer scoring.
- 🛡️ **AGI Safety-First:** Ethical, green, and fully open.

## 🚀 Features

- **Universal Compatibility:** Run on local hardware, in the cloud, or via browser tabs—no expertise required.
- **Seven Benchmark Fields:**  
  - Abstract Reasoning & Mathematics  
  - Scientific Hypothesis & Simulation  
  - Engineering & Tool Orchestration  
  - Multimodal Creative Synthesis  
  - Ethical Self-Governance & Meta-Audit  
  - Recursive Visual Interpretation  
  - Visual Acuity & Perception
- **Mini → Max Paths:** Lightweight text-only, advanced multimodal, and everything in between.
- **Cloud Ready:** Docker images, cloud templates (AWS, GCP, Azure), auto-logging.
- **Easy Tab Testing:** Step-by-step copy/paste tasks for browser LLMs—no install needed.
- **Green Scoring:** Tracks compute usage and efficiency for sustainable AI.

## 🛠️ Quickstart

### 1. **Run in the Cloud**
- **Docker:**  
  ```bash
  docker pull bigrob7605/rgig
  docker run -it bigrob7605/rgig
Colab:
Open Colab Notebook

Cloud Templates:
Launch with AWS/GCP/Azure—see /cloud/README.md for scripts.

2. Test LLMs in Your Browser (Tab Mode)
Open ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.

Copy the Tab Prompt from /tab/README.md (or below).

Paste, follow the test steps, and export results as markdown or YAML/JSON.

3. Self-Hosted (Local)
Install Python 3.11+

Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Bigrob7605/RGIG
cd RGIG
pip install -r requirements.txt
python rgig.py

🧪 Demo Tab Prompt
Paste this into any LLM chat to get started:

You are about to take the RGIG V3.5 benchmark. Respond clearly to each field below.
- For each section (A–G), read the task, provide your answer, and output a YAML or JSON self-audit.
- Mark each section as "Complete" and prompt for the next.
- At the end, summarize your overall audit and score.

Begin with Field A: Abstract Reasoning.

👀 What’s New in V3.5
Cloud & Tab testing support for LLMs and AGI models.

Fields F (recursive visual test) & G (visual acuity) introduced.

Peer review 2.0: decentralized, AI-assisted, bias-calibrated.

One-click Docker/Colab launch, easy onboarding.

YAML/JSON logging for full auditability.

Green/efficiency metrics for sustainable AI.

Optional open leaderboard & agent-as-reviewer coming soon.

💡 FAQ
Q: Who should use RGIG?
A: AI labs, researchers, hobbyists, safety/regulatory orgs—anyone benchmarking real intelligence, not just pattern matching.

Q: Is RGIG open-source?
A: 100%. Apache 2.0 licensed. Fork, remix, contribute.

Q: How do I add my own tasks/fields?
A: Fork the repo, add your custom field (H–Z slots reserved), and open a PR. RGIG is community-extensible.

Q: Can I run this on a Chromebook, or just in the cloud?
A: Yes. Use Tab Mode (browser-based) or launch the Cloud image—zero config needed.

Q: Where do I get help or see sample outputs?
A: See /appendix, /demo, or open an issue. Full examples, YAML schemas, and logs are included.
