> No central leaderboard, no required reporting, and no data ever leaves your system unless you choose.  
> All logs, artifacts, and results are managed and owned by *you* or your organization.  
> Fork, remix, and extend—no permissions needed.

---

## **Cloud Path Integration**

- **Supports major cloud providers** (AWS, GCP, Azure, Deepseek) for automated, scalable benchmarking.

- **Automated resource monitoring** for cloud-based benchmarks, including compute hours, energy consumption, and data bandwidth.

---

## **Why Peer Review Matters**

Every system, build, and hardware stack is unique.  
Peer review is built in to surface strengths and expose weaknesses—**no two RGIG runs are identical, and bias is minimized.**  
This is a *reality-grade* test, not a leaderboard stunt.
